    <h2>CSS란 무엇인가?</h2>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS" target="_blank" title="From Wikipedia" >Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</a> is a style sheet language used for <strong>describing the presentation of a document</strong> written in a markup language such as <U>HTML or XML </u>(including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.</p>

    <p style="margin-top:45px;">CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
